      # The "addresses" option specifies the IP addresses that are to be assigned
      # to the MANAGEMENT-NET interfaces of Ardana OpenStack nodes. In this file,
      # MANAGEMENT network interfaces are assigned addresses from 192.168.10.1 to
      # 192.168.10.250. VSC VM mgmt interface will have an IP address in this
      # range as well. Refer to network_groups.yml.
      #
      # We are specifying the address range in order to reserve some IP addresses for
      # the VSD (which is not created by Ardana OpenStack). In this example, a VSD can
      # be assigned an address in the range of 192.168.10.251 - 192.168.10.254.
      #
      addresses:
        - 192.168.10.1-192.168.10.250
